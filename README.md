Short Circuit Stub Design Project
Amir Hajjari

This is was my Electromagnetic Waves Final Project where we were tasked to solve the problem of eliminating voltage reflections at the load to the source using the Short Circuit Stub Design.
I first did some hand calculations using the input impedance equations, then verified those results with a Smith Chart. 
Then, I designed the Transmission Line in the CST MWS, made adjustments to better match the operating frequency, and made
this presentation!

Included in this repository is the presentation I made over this project.

Thanks for reading!
